3) Design Tokens (Tailwind)
export const tokens = {
  color: {
    teal:  "#05E4C0",
    navy:  "#06062D",
    ink:   "#0E102A",
    paper: "#FFFFFF",
    paper2:"#F7F8FA",
    line:  "#E9EDF3",
    good:  "#16C784",
    warn:  "#FFB020",
  },
  radius: { md: 12, xl: 20, xxl: 28 },
  shadow: { soft: "0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,.08)" },
  font: { brand: '"Cocogoose Pro", Poppins, system-ui' },
};


UI rules: All-white pages, generous whitespace, teal accents; typography navy/ink; tiles over heavy cards; no scroll on common viewports (scale down if needed).

4) Global Components

Header.tsx — shallow, white, bottom hairline; logo → /; links: How it works, Help, Contact.
ProgressRibbon.tsx — on-page under H1; labels: Location • Placement • Waste • Items • Size • Providers • Checkout • Done; animated fill + gentle sheen.
EducationPill.tsx — one per step (bottom, subtle): “Why this matters” + one line.
Overlay.tsx — shallow popovers (search, date, price breakdown), portal z-50, no layout shift.
StickySummary.tsx — mobile bottom or desktop right; shows key selections + running total.

5) Pages (exact flow)
Home (/)

Clean all-white hero.

H1/Sub/Benchmark (above).

Central SearchBar (postcode + address suggestions in portal).

Optional inline toggle: “On the road?” (sets flags.onRoadFromHome).

CTA: Get started → to /location with any filled values.

Location (/location) — 1/8

H1: Confirm the location

Chips: Postcode + Address + Change (overlay search).

Map 16:9; pin drag updates lat/lng + mock W3W input.

EducationPill: “Exact location prevents access issues and permit delays.”

Placement (/placement) — 2/8

H1: Where should we place the skip?

Tiles: On your property / On the road (if road → small permit hint; concierge handled later).

EducationPill: “Driveway avoids permits and often speeds up delivery.”

Type of Waste (/waste) — 3/8

H1: What type of waste is it?

Tiles with consumer labels → operator mapping:

House clearance → Mixed general

Renovation → Builders’ waste

Garden makeover → Green

Soil & Rubble → Soil & stone

DIY Woodwork → Wood

EducationPill: “Right category keeps costs fair and boosts recycling.”

Extra Items (/items) — 4/8

H1: Any of these items?

2-column chip checklist: Mattress, Tyres, Fridge/Freezer, Plasterboard, Gas Bottles, Batteries, Carpet.

Hazardous (Asbestos, Paints/Liquids) → warning overlay.

“None of the above” wide chip.

EducationPill: “Some items need special handling — telling us now avoids surprise charges.”

H1: How much waste do you have?

2×2 tiles: 4yd ≈40 bags; 6yd ≈60; 8yd ≈80; 12yd ≈120; mini sketches; Recommended badge if logic suggests.

EducationPill: “One correct size is cheaper than two smaller ones.”

Interstitial (micro)

1.6–2.0s: Finding providers near {postcode}… with skeleton tiles; smooth crossfade to Providers.

6) 🚀 Providers (Aggregation) — WORLD-CLASS UI (6/8)

Goals: instant comprehension, trust at a glance, side-by-side clarity, zero noise, no pagination (show 6–12). Everything feels like Skyscanner/MoneySuperMarket with Uber’s speed.

Layout

H1: Choose a provider

Tabs (pills): Recommended | Cheapest | Earliest (just sort modes).

ProviderFilters (compact row):

Distance (≤5km / 10km / 20km / Any)

Ratings (⭐4.0+ / 4.5+)

Recycling rate (50%+ / 70%+)

Delivery window (Today / Tomorrow / This week)

Price range (Range slider)

Toggle: Permit-ready only (if road)

Results body: Grid (desktop 3-up; tablet 2-up; mobile 1-up), no paging. Supports 6–12 providers.

StickySummary: bottom (mobile) / right (desktop) with size, items, placement, provisional total; CTA Continue disabled until selection.

Provider Card (dense & delightful)

ProviderCard.tsx (grid tile):

Top row: Logo + Name (Budget Waste Management must be included), ⭐rating, reviews count.

Price (all-in): large, inclusive (base + items + permit + VAT).

Earliest slot: “Earliest: Tue AM (8–11)” with small clock icon.

Badges:

Licensed Operator

Permit-ready

High Recycling {xx%}

On-time {xx%}

What’s included (bulleted, 3 items)

PricePopover (click “Breakdown”) with table:

Base (size)

Extras (line-items)

Permit (if road)

VAT

Total

Select button → teal ring appears around card; card moves to Selected state.

ProviderRowCompact.tsx (list toggle): condensed, row style with same data; use a view toggle to A/B test Grid vs List density.

Sorting Logic (tabs)

Recommended (weighted score): total price (35%), earliest delivery (25%), rating (20%), recycling% (20%).

Cheapest: ascending total price.

Earliest: soonest window; tie-breakers = rating → price.

Filters (live, no reload)

All filters update the list instantly; count badge (“8 matches”) animates.

“Clear filters” pill visible when any filter active.

Compare (drawer)

User can add up to 3 providers to Compare (checkbox on card).

ProviderCompareDrawer.tsx slides up: columnar comparison of Price, Earliest, Rating, Recycling, On-time, Inclusions.

CTA: Choose {ProviderName} or close.

Map toggle (optional)

Small toggle: Map view shows pins coloured by price gradient; selecting pin highlights card.

Micro-interactions

Cards enter with 40ms stagger; hover lift 2px; select gives teal ring + subtle glow.

PricePopover animates scale+fade (180ms).

When user selects a provider, StickySummary shows “Selected: {ProviderName}”.

Accessibility

Cards are radio buttons in a group (arrow keys to move, space to select).

Filters usable via keyboard and have aria-labels.

PricePopover opens focus-trapped; Esc closes.

Empty/edge states

No results: show guidance — “Try widening the delivery window or removing filters.”

Permit-only constraint (road): show “Permit-ready” filter pre-ticked with info link.

7) Checkout (7/8)

Two columns, white surface, condensed:

Left: PaymentPanel — PaymentRequestButton (Apple/Google Pay) above Payment Element (Card); compact inputs (name/email/phone), driver notes, choose Collection date.

Right: Order summary (location, placement, waste, items, size, chosen provider, delivery window, permit line, subtotal + VAT + total).

Compliance strip above pay button: “Licensed operator • Waste transfer note • GPS drop • Chain of custody”.

CTA: Confirm & Pay → success → /confirmation.

8) Confirmation (8/8)

Success Lottie, clean order card: reference, provider, delivery/collection windows.

Actions: Download transfer note (PDF mock), Add to calendar (iCal), Book another.

9) State & Pricing (mock realistic)

Zustand store

{
  postcode, address, lat, lng, w3w,
  placement: "driveway" | "road",
  wasteType, items: string[],
  size: "4yd" | "6yd" | "8yd" | "12yd",
  providerId,
  deliveryDate, collectionDate,
  customer: { name, email, phone },
  totals: { base, extras, permit, vat, total },
  flags: { onRoadFromHome?: boolean }
}


pricing.ts

basePrice(size, provider)

extrasPrice(items[])

permitFee(placement, postcode) (use councils.ts bands)

totalExVat = base + extras + permit

vat = 0.2

total = totalExVat * (1 + vat)

providers.ts

8–12 providers (must include Budget Waste Management), each with:

priceBySize (4/6/8/12yd)

earliestWindow(postcode) → { dayLabel, range }

rating, reviews, recyclingPct, onTimePct

badges: string[] (e.g., “Licensed Operator”, “Permit-ready”)

distanceKm(postcode) mock

10) EducationPill (copy library)

Location: “Exact location prevents access issues and speeds up delivery.”

Placement: “Driveway avoids permits; roadside may require council approval.”

Waste: “The right category keeps costs fair and increases recycling.”

Items: “Some items need special handling — avoid surprise charges.”

Size: “One correct size is cheaper than two small ones.”

Providers: “We rank real value: total price, timing, reviews, and recycling.”

Checkout: “You’ll receive a digital waste transfer note for full compliance.”

11) Motion & Transitions

Stage transitions: crossfade + 16px slide (220–260ms, ease [0.16,1,0.3,1]).

Interstitial before Providers (1.6–2.0s) with skeleton tiles.

Overlays (search, price, date): scale+fade 180ms; portal; no layout shift.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

12) Accessibility

H1 receives focus on each step.

Tiles/cards are proper radios; filters reachable by keyboard; popovers trap focus.

Text contrast AA on white; teal accents pass WCAG.

13) Testing

Unit (Vitest/RTL)

Pricing adds permit only when placement="road".

Provider sorting works for Recommended/Cheapest/Earliest.

Filters reduce result set and update count badge.

Selecting provider updates store.providerId and StickySummary.

E2E (Playwright)

Happy path (driveway): Home → Location → Driveway → Waste → No items → 6yd → Providers (Recommended) → Select → Checkout (4242) → Confirmation.

Road + permit: Placement=Road → “Permit-ready only” filter on → select → total includes permit → pay → confirmation.

Wallet path: Payment Request Button appears → mock Apple/Google Pay → confirmation.

Reduced motion: animations off; flow remains usable.

14) Visual Polish (providers focus)

Grid/list toggle for density A/B.

Heat-map price tint on Map view pins (cheaper = cooler tint).

Reviews microtext (“1,248 reviews”) under rating.

Trust icons small and consistent: shield (Licensed), leaf (Recycling), clock (On-time), badge (Permit-ready).

Zero hidden fees label under price; PricePopover reveals math.
